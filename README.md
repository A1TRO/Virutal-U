## Start the project:
The setup for now is for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) users only. If you are a repl.it user and non-beginner programmer, you can read the setup below but you have to edit the Environment processing for MongoDB and the bot token.
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
3. Open command prompt and then type `node -v` and make sure that you have installed node.js version **16.9.0** or above.
4. [Download the project](https://github.com/TFAGaming/DiscordJS-Commands-Handler/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the folder from .zip folder to a normal folder.
5. Open the folder on a new VSCode tab.
6. Go to `src/config/main.js` and edit the properties of each file.
7. Open terminal, use the command `cd` to access to your project folder, then type `node index.js`, `node .`, or `npm start`.
